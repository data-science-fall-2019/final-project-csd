Sam:

The analyses I will perform are based on the retention rates and earnings after graduation variables. 
I will be creating boxplots, barplots, scatterplots based on different retention rates for different types of institution(4-year, less than 4-year, etc) and create respective plots based on years of after graduation. 

In my shiny app, I will create data visualizations for these graphs, while selecting different earning variables and retention variables. 
I'd like to create reactive linear regressions and t-tests and generate the respective results when we're choosing difffent variables. 


Jack:

I will perform the undergraduate Student Body by Race and Gender.
Also, I will perform the average faculty salary with out state tuition fee and average faculty salary with in state tuition.

From the shiny app, I will make plot to visualize with undergraduate Student Body by Race and Gender.
What is more, I will make linear regression for average faculty salary with out state tuition fee and average faculty salary with in state tuition.




Ai:


Till now, I have already made several boxplots about the family income. 
Later, I prefer to use ANOVA to analysis whether these five different income level would have the same mean of the percentage bewteen these three different type of universities. 

As for the shiny app, firstly we would create a tab with the basic information of the university what we choose, and for the tab of family income, I would like to make one tab that when we choose one university, it would show us the percentage of each income level with a barplot, and also if we type in the income of one customer, it would show the boxplot of each income level.
