# Variational Genotyping for Polyploids

Repo for exploring the potential for using variational techniques to genotype polyploids in STAN.

For initial analyses, we will explore family income variable, undergraduate race and gender, and the retention rate and earnings.
To begin with, considering there are categorical variable and quantitative variable in our target variables. 
We plotted them with boxplot. We also made the summary statistics to give our users more details. 
In addition, we will have additional analyses with linear regression and we will apply it for predicting retention rate on earnings. 
For tentative ideas for our shiny app, we planned to do three to five sheets in shiny app, which contains different plots and summary statistics. In the first sheet, we want to make introduction for each school with race and gender in order to show diversity in each school.
